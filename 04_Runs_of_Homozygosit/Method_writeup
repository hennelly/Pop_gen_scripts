We inferred runs of homozygosity (ROH) using BCFtools/RoH (Narasimhan et al. 2016). Along with the GATK filtering criteria, we included only biallelic SNPs that had all individuals present per site (--max-missing 1, --min-alleles 2, --max-alleles 2). We also included SNPs that had a depth of more than one third and less than double of the average depth of coverage for each sample, where we chose samples that were >15x. For the BCFtools/RoH analysis, we fixed the alternative allele frequency to 0.4 (-AFdflt 0.4) and used the dog recombination map from Auton et al. 201x to account for recombination hotspots (--genetic-map). We kept ROHs that had a quality score of at least 80 and excluded ROHs that were below 100 kb in length in our analysis.
