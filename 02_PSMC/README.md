To infer the historical demography of wolves in Eurasia, we used the Pairwise Sequential Markovian Coalescent (PSMC; Li and Durbin 2011). PSMC uses a coalescent approach to estimate the history of change in effective population sizes over time. We only included the autosomal sequences of each gray wolf individual. We converted each bam file to a fasta-like consensus sequence by first using the mpileup command with SAMtools and subsequently using BCFtools view –c to call variants and vcfultils.pl vcf2fq to convert the vcf file to fastq format (Danecek et al. 2021). We excluded any reads that were less than 20 for minimum mapping quality and minimum base quality (-q 20 -Q 20) and excluded reads with excessive mismatches (-C 50). We also removed sites with more than double or less than a third of the average depth of coverage for each sample. We tested different combinations of parameters to infer the PSMC, which were “psmc -N25 -t15 -r5 -p 4+25*2+4+6”, “psmc -N25 -t15 -r5 -p 2+2+25*2+4+6” and “psmc -N25 -t15 -r5 -p 1+1+1+1+25*2+4+6” following previous studies on gray wolves and recent recommendations for inferring PSMC trajectories (Hilgers et al. 2024). Some samples showed a false peak when using the parameter “psmc -N25 -t15 -r5 -p 4+25*2+4+6”, therefore, we used the parameter “psmc -N25 -t15 -r5 -p 1+1+1+1+25*2+4+6” for our final analyses (Figure S25).


To account for our selected low coverage genomes (15-20x), we estimated the false negative rate (FNR) by a downsampling high coverage gray wolf genome that were in the same geographic region to the specific depth of the low coverage genome. To determine the best FNR, we visually estimated the best correspondence between the PSMC plots with the high coverage (>20x) regional wolf genome and downsampled genomes with various FNR corrections (Figure S26). We then applied the best estimated FNR to the low coverage gray wolf genomes to infer their demographic history. We used a mutation rate of 4.5 x 10-9 (Koch et al. 2019) and a generation time of 4.4 years (Mech and Barber-Meyer 2017).
