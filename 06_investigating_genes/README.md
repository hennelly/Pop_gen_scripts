## Scripts for investigating structural variations and genes of interests 

### Investigating per-SNPs differences within selected genes 
 - Extract genes from VCF and filter: 01_extract_genes.sh
      - For my analyses, I kept indels in my VCF to better detect small structural variants, and converted any individual's site that was under 3x as missing (--minDP 3)
 - Per-SNP scan:

### Investigating presence of structural variants with per-site depth
